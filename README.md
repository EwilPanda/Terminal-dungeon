# Terminal-dungeon

## Content
I worked on it as an exercice from [CodeDex](https://www.codedex.io/) 

Let yourself join me in a little adventure in a gloomy and labyrinthine forest full of monsters. I recommand you to draw a map when you play, but dont worry, it is quite small.

## Dev Comments
The code looks a little messy due to the lack of fuctions. I plan to rework it

There is a lot of loops to let the player return to their previous location. That allows you to roam the labyrinth freely.
